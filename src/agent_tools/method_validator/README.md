# 🛠️ Cursor Agent Tools

A collection of specialized tools designed to enhance AI agent capabilities within the Cursor IDE. These tools enable more intelligent code analysis, validation, and generation while preventing common AI pitfalls like method hallucination and redundant implementations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains a growing collection of tools that help AI agents (like myself) work more effectively within Cursor. Each tool is designed to solve specific challenges in AI-assisted development:

- Preventing method hallucination
- Validating API usage
- Discovering existing functionality
- Ensuring correct implementation patterns
- Maintaining code quality and consistency

## 📦 Available Tools

### Method Validator ✅

The Method Validator is a specialized tool that helps AI agents analyze Python packages, discover existing methods, and validate APIs before implementing new solutions. This prevents redundant code creation and ensures correct API usage.

Key features:
- Smart package analysis with filtering of standard libraries
- Detailed method discovery and validation
- Intelligent categorization of methods
- Exception pattern analysis
- Optimized caching system
- Machine-readable output for automated processing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agent-tools.git
cd agent-tools

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Using with Cursor

These tools are designed to be used seamlessly within the Cursor IDE. When working with an AI agent in Cursor, you can trigger specific tools using designated prompts:

```
TOOL: method_validator - Implement [task description]
```

Example:
```
TOOL: method_validator - Write a function to extract tables from a webpage using Playwright
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

1. **Prevention Over Correction**
   - Tools focus on preventing common AI mistakes rather than fixing them after the fact
   - Built-in validation and verification at every step

2. **Intelligent Caching**
   - Optimized caching systems to improve response times
   - Smart invalidation based on source changes

3. **Machine-First Design**
   - All tools provide machine-readable output
   - Structured data formats for easy parsing
   - Clear success/failure indicators

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Tools work with basic functionality out of the box
   - Advanced features available for more complex use cases

## ⚠️ Note for Human Developers

While these tools are primarily designed for AI agents, they can also be valuable for human developers:

- Use Method Validator to explore unfamiliar packages
- Leverage automated API discovery
- Benefit from intelligent caching and analysis

However, the primary focus remains on enhancing AI agent capabilities within Cursor.

# Method Validator

A tool for analyzing and validating Python package methods.

## Features

- Quick validation of method existence and accessibility
- Deep analysis of method signatures, parameters, and documentation
- Caching of analysis results for improved performance
- Support for nested methods (e.g. `_Logger.add`)

## Usage

### Quick Validation

To quickly check if a method exists and is accessible:

```bash
method-validator package_name --method method_name --quick
```

This performs a fast check without deep analysis, ideal for:
- Verifying method existence
- Basic validation during development
- CI/CD pipelines

Example:
```bash
method-validator loguru --method _Logger.add --quick
```

### Deep Analysis

For detailed method analysis:

```bash
method-validator package_name --method method_name
```

This provides:
- Method signature
- Parameter details
- Documentation
- Exception information

Example:
```bash
method-validator loguru --method _Logger.add
```

### List All Methods

To list all methods in a package:

```bash
method-validator package_name --list-all
```

## Cache Management

Analysis results are cached to improve performance. The cache:
- Stores results in SQLite database
- Automatically cleans up old entries
- Validates against source code changes

## Exit Codes

- 0: Success
- 1: Method not found or error
