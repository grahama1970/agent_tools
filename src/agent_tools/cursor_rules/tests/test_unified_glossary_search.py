Test Unified Glossary Search

This test validates the unified glossary search system that combines:
1. Embedded term extraction
2. Fuzzy matching using RapidFuzz
3. Semantic search
4. Related term identification

Together, these provide comprehensive coverage for identifying relevant
glossary terms in user questions.
