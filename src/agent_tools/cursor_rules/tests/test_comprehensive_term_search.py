Comprehensive Term Search Test

This test validates:
1. Extraction of embedded terms from user questions in [TERM: term] format
2. Matching embedded terms with glossary definitions
3. Finding semantically similar terms beyond exact matches
4. Retrieving all related terms and definitions that might be relevant
