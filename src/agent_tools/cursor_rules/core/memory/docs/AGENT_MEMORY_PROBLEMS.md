# Summary of Issues with AgentMemorySystem

## Overview
This project aims to implement an Agent Memory System that:
- Persists facts in ArangoDB
- Supports importance-based decay and recency boosting
- Allows for knowledge correction (via upsert)
- Provides confidence scoring and semantic/BM25 text search

The system is tested using integration tests against a real ArangoDB instance (version 3.12.4) with the python‑arango driver (version 8.1.6).

## Issues Encountered

### 1. **Index Creation Errors**

**Problem:**
- During initialization, the code creates indexes on the facts collection using methods like `add_persistent_index()` with keyword arguments (e.g., `name` and `unique`), which are no longer accepted by the current python‑arango API.

**Error Messages:**
- “Collection.add_index() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'”
- “Collection.add_index() got an unexpected keyword argument 'unique'”
- “... got an unexpected keyword argument 'fields'”

**Cause:**
- The code is not following the latest documentation for index creation. The new API expects only positional arguments (fields list and index type) and does not support custom names or uniqueness constraints via keyword arguments.

**Attempts to Fix:**
- Modified calls to `add_index()` to only pass the required fields list and the index type (e.g., `"persistent"`), removing any custom naming or uniqueness parameters.
- Referenced [Python‑Arango Indexes Documentation](https://docs.python-arango.com/en/main/indexes.html#indexes) for guidance.

### 2. **Bind Parameter "query_embedding" in AQL Recall Query**

**Problem:**
- When running the `recall` method, an error occurs indicating that the bind parameter `@query_embedding` is not declared in the query.

**Error Message:**
- “[HTTP 400][ERR 1552] bind parameter 'query_embedding' was not declared in the query”

**Cause:**
- The AQL query is constructed conditionally based on whether semantic search is enabled. In cases where semantic search isn’t valid, the parameter should not be used. However, our logic did not entirely exclude `query_embedding` from the bind variables in those cases.

**Attempts to Fix:**
- Introduced conditional logic to add `query_embedding` to `bind_vars` only if a valid embedding is available.
- Verified the logic using logs to ensure that when semantic search isn’t applicable, the parameter is not used.
- Referenced [ArangoDB AQL Bind Parameters Documentation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/aql/bind-parameters.html).

### 3. **Domain Filtering Logic**

**Problem:**
- Tests expect that the recall method returns only facts that include the domain `"ai"`. However, some queries return facts without `"ai"` (e.g., a fact with domains `["programming", "technology"]`).

**Error Message:**
- “Domain filtering failed: Result has domains ['programming', 'technology'] but 'ai' is missing”

**Cause:**
- The AQL query and/or the additional Python-based filtering do not enforce a strict requirement that the returned fact’s domains include `"ai"`.
- There may be a discrepancy between how the AQL function `INTERSECTION` behaves and the expectations in the test.

**Attempts to Fix:**
- Adjusted the Python filtering to check that at least one domain in the result exactly matches `"ai"` (case-insensitively).
- Reviewed the [ArangoDB INTERSECTION Documentation](https://docs.arangodb.com/3.12/aql/functions/array/#intersection) to ensure the intended behavior.
- Ensured that stored domain values are normalized (i.e., always in lowercase).

---

### 4. **Fallback Behavior Between Semantic and BM25 Search**

**Problem:**
- When semantic search fails (or returns no results), the fallback BM25-only query sometimes does not enforce the domain filter, resulting in unexpected results.

**Cause:**
- The fallback BM25 query may not have the same domain filter logic as the semantic search branch.
- Inconsistent query parameters (thresholds and weights) between the two search methods lead to different behaviors.

**Attempts to Fix:**
- Reviewed and attempted to align the domain filtering criteria between both search branches.
- Adjusted thresholds and weights so that the domain filter is applied in both cases.
- Verified by manually checking the query results via logs.

---

## History of Fix Attempts

- **Initial Implementation:** Used deprecated methods for index creation and constructed the recall AQL query without proper conditional handling of the `query_embedding` bind variable.
- **First Iterations:** Attempted to replace deprecated keyword arguments with positional parameters (fields list and index type only).
- **Subsequent Iterations:** Added conditional logic to include or remove the `query_embedding` bind variable based on whether semantic search is enabled.
- **Final Attempts:** Implemented additional Python-level filtering to enforce domain requirements strictly, yet the recall method sometimes still returns facts that do not include `"ai"`.

---

## Conclusion

The primary obstacles have been:
- **Index Creation:** Adapting to the new python‑arango API without using unsupported keyword arguments.
- **Bind Parameter Handling:** Correctly excluding `query_embedding` when semantic search is disabled.
- **Domain Filtering:** Ensuring that only facts with the expected domain are returned by both the AQL query and subsequent Python filtering.
- **Fallback Consistency:** Aligning the fallback BM25 query to enforce the same domain filtering as the semantic query.

Despite multiple iterations and adjustments, these issues remain unresolved in our current implementation. I hope this summary helps you document the challenges and seek further specialized assistance.
