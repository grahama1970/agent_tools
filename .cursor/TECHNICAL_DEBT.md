## Issue TD-001: Duplicate Database Implementations

**Status**: Active  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: March 2024  
**Violates**: LESSONS_LEARNED.md - "Architectural Issues" and "Directory Structure" principles

### Description

The project currently has two competing database implementations:
1. `src/agent_tools/cursor_rules/core/db.py`: Basic database connection functionality
2. `src/agent_tools/cursor_rules/enhanced_db.py`: Enhanced graph-based implementation

This violates our architectural principles by:
- Scattering functionality across multiple modules
- Creating confusion about which implementation to use
- Duplicating database connection logic
- Making the codebase harder to maintain

### Current Impact

1. Code using database functionality must choose between two implementations
2. New developers may be confused about which module to use
3. Bug fixes and improvements must be synchronized across both files
4. Testing is complicated by having two sources of truth

### Affected Components

1. CLI implementations using database functionality
2. Test files that interact with the database
3. Any code requiring graph features or search capabilities

### Current Mitigation

Both files have been documented with clear warnings and usage guidance:
- New development should use `enhanced_db.py`
- `db.py` should only be used by existing code until refactoring
- Documentation links and warnings have been added to both files

### Refactoring Plan

1. **Phase 1: Preparation**
   - [ ] Identify all usages of both database implementations
   - [ ] Document current feature usage and requirements
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for database functionality

2. **Phase 2: Consolidation**
   - [ ] Merge enhanced features into core/db.py
   - [ ] Update all imports to use consolidated implementation
   - [ ] Ensure all graph and search features are preserved
   - [ ] Verify async patterns follow LESSONS_LEARNED.md guidelines

3. **Phase 3: Testing**
   - [ ] Run full test suite against consolidated implementation
   - [ ] Verify all CLI functionality works with new implementation
   - [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
   - [ ] Validate async behavior in all scenarios

4. **Phase 4: Cleanup**
   - [ ] Remove enhanced_db.py
   - [ ] Update all documentation references
   - [ ] Verify no remaining references to old implementation
   - [ ] Add regression tests to prevent future splits

### Success Criteria

1. Single database implementation in core/db.py
2. All tests passing with consolidated implementation
3. No degradation in functionality or performance
4. Clear documentation of all database features
5. Proper async handling following LESSONS_LEARNED.md

### Notes

This consolidation should be done as a dedicated refactoring sprint to minimize risk and ensure proper testing. The work should not be mixed with feature development to maintain clear boundaries and rollback capabilities.
