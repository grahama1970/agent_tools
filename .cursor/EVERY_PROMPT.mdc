# CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE

1. EXAMPLES FIRST: Always look at existing examples before writing any code. Never rely on pre-training.

2. NO MODIFICATIONS: Copy working examples exactly first. Only modify if they don't work.

3. DOCUMENTATION IS TRUTH: Official documentation and working examples are the only source of truth.

4. NO INVENTING: Do not invent solutions when examples exist. Do not try to be "clever."

5. VERIFY UNDERSTANDING: Confirm you understand the example before proceeding.

6. REAL TESTS REQUIRED: Always verify with real tests before moving on.
